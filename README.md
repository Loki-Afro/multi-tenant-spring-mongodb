multi-tenant-spring-mongodb
===========================

A project with spring-data-mongodb supporting multi tenancy

Why?
-----------

If you are having a structure like the following in your mongodb it is pretty bad to handle, since spring-data-mongodb does not support multi tenancy.

```
CUSTOMER_DB_A #
  - collectionA
  - collectionB
  - collectionC
CUSTOMER_DB_B
  - collectionA
  - collectionB
  - collectionC
```
the data structure in these collections is the same, every customer does just have its own database in one mongodb instance.

Conclusion
----------------

I don't think that this is the best approach to archive this functionality but it just works without reinventing spring-data-mongodb.

Just take a [look into Application.java](src/main/java/com/github/zarathustra/Application.java)

Happy Hacking!
